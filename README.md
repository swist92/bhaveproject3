## Description

This is an application that will allow a user to improve their own and other's wellbeing. Members of B'Have can write compliments for their friends and family and see others user activity on the Hive, a public activity page. In addition, B'Have members can send gifts to loved ones and even pay it forward by donating to a local charity of their choice. Our mission in creating B'Have is that no matter how small the act, injecting kindness into your every day can make positive, lasting change in the world around us.
